#Simple To-Do List App

This app allows you to stay organised by helping you keep track of your daily tasks.

You can also use it as a Shopping List.


// HOW TO USE THE APP

1. Delete the sample items in the list

2. Enter your items and submit by clicking the "Enter" button with your mouse
    or simple press enter on your keyboard to have your item submitted into
    the list.
    
    PS. The app will not allow you to enter "whitespaces" or "blank data" into the list.
    In a case like that, you will be prompted to make an entry.
3. You can click on an item to strike-through it, if the said item/task is completed.
4. You can delete an item by simply clicking on the "X" button next to the item.


Always remember to work from a list if you want to productive.

Enjoy!
